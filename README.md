# Next.js and shadcn/ui

This is a blank project that uses Next.js 14 for the framework and shadcn for the UI.

## About shadcn

According to the docs:

> This is NOT a component library. It's a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your apps.
>
> Pick the components you need. Copy and paste the code into your project and customize to your needs. The code is yours.

That said, you still need to install the shadcn CLI. I've already done that for this project, so all you need to do is head over to [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and grab the components you need.

## Installation

Fork and clone this repo.

Then run

```bash

npm install

npm run dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
